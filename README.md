# Leaf-Disease-Detection-InceptionV3

Leaf disease classification is a common problem in agriculture, where it is essential to detect diseases early and prevent the spread of infections. InceptionV3 is a pre-trained deep learning model that is commonly used for image classification tasks. In this approach, we can use the InceptionV3 model to classify leaf diseases from images.
